Amplitudes of all analyzed responses were significant in comparison to a 1s 
prestimulus baseline (dependent samples t-tests; p<0.01 for all comparisons).
Moreover, amplitudes were modulated by stimulus intensity as indicated by 
3 (intensity levels)x3 (conditions) repeated-measures ANOVAs. As expected, 
amplitudes of all responses either increased (P2 and gamma) or decreased 
(N1 and N2) with increasing stimulus intensity (N1: F(2, 80)=13.66, p<0.001;
N2: F(2, 76)=6.30, p=0.003; P2: F(2, 82)=30.26, p=0.001;
gamma: F(2, 98)=13.78, p<0.001; Greenhouse-Geisser corrected where necessary).
In addition, amplitudes of N1 (F(2, 98)=4.89, p<0.015) and gamma
(F(1, 66)=7.21, p=0.001) but not of N2 (F(2, 87)=1.97, p=0.15) 
and P2 (F(2, 98)=0.12, p=0.90) responses were influenced by condition. 
Post hoc pairwise comparisons confirmed a significantly more negative N1 
response amplitude in the motor than in the perception (t(49)=4.37, p=0.001)
and autonomic conditions (t(49)=âˆ’4.29, p<0.001) as well as stronger gamma 
responses in the motor than in the autonomic condition (t(49)=3.02, p=0.01; 
all p-values Bonferroni-corrected). Taken together, noxious stimuli elicited a 
well-known pattern of electrophysiological responses, including N1, N2, and P2
waves5,6, and gamma oscillations7, which were influenced by stimulus intensity 
and in part by condition.
